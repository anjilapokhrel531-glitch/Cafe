    <h2>A Vision Built on Friendship and Fine Coffee</h2>

    <p>
        Morning Breeze Cafe was established in 2020 by two long-time friends, Maya and Sanjay, who shared a simple dream: to create a warm gathering place for their neighborhood. The location, right next to the town's oldest pedestrian bridge, inspired the name and our welcoming philosophy. We designed the space to be bright and airy, perfect for either quiet work or lively conversation. Over the years, we have grown into a beloved local landmark, hosting poetry nights, small acoustic sets, and community events. Our commitment to high-quality ingredients and friendly service remains our core value. We hope to see you soon!
